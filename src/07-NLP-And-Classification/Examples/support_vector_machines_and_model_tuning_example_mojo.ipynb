    "How do support vector machines work? \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept itself is quite simple. Let's pretend that we want to classify data points into group $A$ or group $B$. To do this, an SVM will plot our labelled training data as points in space and will look for the widest, clearest gap between points belonging to group A and points belonging to group B. It will then use this newly identified dividing line (known as a hyperplane) and the margin around it to classify new observations. An unseen data point will be classified into group A or B depending on which side of the margin it is closest to. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy to do this when our data only has two features. We only need a simple one-dimensional decision boundary (which is basically a line) to classify the data. However, as more features get added the line needs to take on more dimensions because a simple line will no longer work. A line only has one dimension. A flat shape has two dimensions. A 3D shape (unsurprisingly) has three. What do we call something with four or more dimensions? In this case, it's a hyperplane. In SVM, the hyperplane will always have one less dimension ($-1$) than the number of input features ($p$), or a total of $(p-1)$ dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain it in more technical terms, the basic idea of the SVM is to separate points using a $(p - 1)$ dimensional hyperplane. What does it mean to separate points? This means that the SVM will construct a decision boundary such that points on the left are assigned a label of $A$ and points on the right are assigned a label of $B$.  When finding this separating hyperplane, we wish to maximise the distance of the nearest points to the hyperplane. The technical term for this is **maximum separating hyperplane**. The data points that dictate where the separating hyperplane goes are called **support vectors**. Have a look at a diagram of the margin, hyperplane, and support vectors below: \n",

    "Read more about SVMs and how they work [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs are interesting models. Like logistic regression, they fit a linear decision boundary. However, unlike logistic regression, SVMs do this in a non-probabilistic way and are able to fit to non-linear data using an algorithm known as the [kernel trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method). Furthermore, SVMs can be used for both classification and regression. In `sklearn`, these are called `SVC` (support vector classifier) and `SVR` (support vector regression) respectively. \n",

For this purpose, we will use `sklearn`'s [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html). This procedure allows us to specify a set of possible parameters for a specific model. `GridSearchCV` will then go through those parameters and try every possible combination of them (kind of like it's working through a grid in a systematic way – that's where the name comes from). `GridSearchCV` will then return the combination of parameters that resulted in a model with the best score. \n",

    "In our scenario, the untuned model with a linear kernel achieved a higher accuracy of 98.33% compared to the tuned model with an `rbf` kernel, which had an accuracy of 96.67%. The untuned linear model performed better due to the inherent **simplicity of the linear decision boundary**, which was effective in separating the classes in the dataset. However, despite the lower accuracy, the tuned `rbf` model offers several advantages. Firstly, it has the **flexibility to capture non-linear relationships** in the data, which may result in better generalisation to unseen data in more complex datasets. Additionally, the process of hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV allows for **optimisation of model performance** by finding the best combination of hyperparameters. Even though the untuned model performed well in this case, using a tuned model is essential for maximising model performance, ensuring robustness and improving generalisation to diverse datasets and real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few things to note about `GridSearchCV`. It takes a base model (in this case, an SVC classifier) and a grid of parameters (our `parameters` dictionary) as input. By default, `GridSearchCV` will continuously refit the model until it finds the model with the best combination of parameters and will return it to the user. Here, we saved the best model as `clf`.\n",

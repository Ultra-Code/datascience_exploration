    "\n",
    "Python is globally a very popular programming language, used across fields such as software development, data science,  and AI. These use cases require data to be stored efficiently and in such a way that it can be accessed quickly. Python achieves this through its core concepts that form the backbone of effective programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As an introduction to these concepts, we'll delve into variables, understand the intricacies of memory allocation, navigate the best practices for naming conventions, and embark on a journey through the diverse landscape of Python's data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong grasp of these fundamental concepts is paramount in the realm of programming. **Variables** serve as the **building blocks** for manipulating and organising data, while **memory allocation** determines how efficiently our program utilises **system resources**. Adhering to **naming conventions** not only enhances **code readability** but also promotes consistency across projects. As we explore the rich tapestry of Python's data types, we'll gain insights into handling numerical values, strings, and booleans and discover the power of functions like `round()`."

    "We have now learned about the primitive data types that exist in Python. We have also learned about built-in functions and methods and how they can be used on the different data types. We now have a good understanding of the use of variables when writing code in Python, as well as how to assign different data types to variables and the naming conventions used for variables. "

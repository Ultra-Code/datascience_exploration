    "## Big O notation and complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O notation is a formal mathematical notation that helps us define the performance and complexity of a given algorithm. It is defined as the asymptotic upper limit of a function. In other words, it is a notation that helps us know what the maximum *space* (storage) or *time* (speed) requirements are when running a piece of code. This notation helps us predict worst-case performance and allows for various algorithms to be compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at Big O notation, there are two aspects to its syntax. Let's say we characterise an algorithm as being $O(x)$ in nature. Here, the $O$ refers to the *order* of the algorithm, and the quantity inside the brackets ($x$ in this case) is the associated growth rate or order. We often express this growth rate in terms of $n$ or the *number of elements* upon which the algorithm needs to act.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the figure below to help us visually compare the growth rates for some of the complexity categories described by Big O notation. As seen, the order of an algorithm can lead to significantly different complexities being realised with only a small number of input elements.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding computational complexity and Big O notation is crucial for assessing the **efficiency and scalability of algorithms**. It allows developers to make informed decisions about algorithm selection, particularly when dealing with large datasets or resource-constrained environments. By providing a **standardised way to express the upper bounds on an algorithm's time and space requirements**, Big O notation facilitates comparisons and predictions of performance. For example, an algorithm with $O(2^N)$ time complexity may become impractical for large inputs, while an O(logN) algorithm is more scalable. This knowledge empowers developers to **optimise code**, **choose appropriate algorithms**, and **design systems** that can handle varying workloads, ultimately leading to more efficient and robust software solutions."

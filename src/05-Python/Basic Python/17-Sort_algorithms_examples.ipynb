In the **first iteration**, the largest element moves from the left to the right, and the swapping pairs are `5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 5/1`. In the **second iteration**, the swapping pairs are `4/3, 4/2, 4/1`. In the **third iteration**, we have `3/2, 3/1`, and in the **fourth iteration**, we only have a single pair, `2/1`. \n",

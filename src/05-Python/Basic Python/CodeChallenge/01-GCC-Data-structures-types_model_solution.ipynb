Your brilliant work has not only improved lives but also opened doors to new possibilities. Now, we have another thrilling challenge ahead of us, and I believe it's right up our alley!\n",
    "\n",
    "We're stepping into a domain where technology meets agriculture. Maji Ndogo, with your help, is looking to revolutionise its farming industry through automation, using the power of data science and AI. The long-term goal? Fully autonomous farming equipment that can intelligently manage and optimise agricultural processes. Exciting, isn't it?\n",

    "However, before we dive into the world of AI-driven tractors and smart irrigation systems, we need to lay the groundwork. Our first step is to tackle how we can programmatically represent this problem. Think of it as creating a 'Digital Twin' of the farming ecosystem in Maji Ndogo.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Digital Twin will be our sandbox, where we can experiment, analyse, and fine-tune our approaches before implementing them in the real world. But how do we build such a model? How do we ensure it accurately reflects the complexities of a real farm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where our Python skills come into play. We’ll start by representing various elements of a farm – like fields, crops, and farming equipment. We will have to encapsulate operations like planting, watering, and harvesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is just scratching the surface. We'll encounter and solve various challenges along the way, using more advanced concepts and techniques. But I'm confident that with your skills and enthusiasm, we'll make this project another success story.\n",

    "In the world of digital farming, the first step is to bring our farm machinery into the digital realm. Let's start with the tractor, the workhorse of the farm. Digitising the tractor allows us to simulate and analyse its performance, maintenance needs, and usage patterns. This data-driven approach can lead to more efficient use of machinery, saving time and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use a dictionary for this? In Python, a dictionary is a versatile and intuitive way to store and access data. It allows us to create a clear, structured representation of an object by mapping keys (property names) to values (property details). This is ideal for representing complex objects like tractors with multiple attributes.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dictionary should include the following keys: \n",
    "`model`, `colour`, `horsepower`, and `fuel_capacity`. You can choose appropriate values for these keys based on what a typical tractor might have."

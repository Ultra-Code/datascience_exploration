    "1. **Improved readability**: Well-structured print statements make code more readable, allowing developers to quickly understand the purpose of each print statement.\n",

    "3. **Facilitates collaboration**: Clear print statements make it easier for team members to comprehend and contribute to the codebase, promoting collaboration among developers.\n",
    "4. **Documentation aid**: Print statements serve as a form of documentation, offering insights into the program's behaviour and helping developers understand the code without delving into details.\n",
    "5. **Communicate with users**: Messages displayed through print statements offer users insights into the program's progress and results, making the application more user-friendly."

    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `format()` method is a built-in string method in Python that allows us to format strings by inserting values into placeholders. The general syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`formatted_string = \"This is a string where we display two values: {} and {}.\".format(value1, value2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this syntax, `{}` are placeholders that will be replaced by the values passed to the `format()` method. The variables are inserted into the string in the order that they are listed in the `format()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `format()` function is particularly handy when we want to create dynamic strings with variable content. It helps improve code readability and maintainability by separating the string structure from the actual values. Strings can be saved in variables and printed later, or they can be created in the `print()` statement itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the annual growth rate of trees (`growth_rate`) and the region of the forest (`forest_region`), use the `format()` method to print a statement in the format: \"The annual growth rate of trees in the Amazon forest is 2.5%.\""

    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "F-strings, or formatted string literals, provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals. Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings make string formatting more readable and expressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "An f-string is a string literal prefixed with `'f'` or `'F'`. It allows us to embed expressions inside curly braces `{}` within the string, and these expressions will be evaluated and formatted at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "`formatted_string = f\"{value1} and {value2} are displayed using an f-string.\" `\n",

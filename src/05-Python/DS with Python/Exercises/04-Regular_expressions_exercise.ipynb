    "1. **Regular expression pattern**: The regex `\\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s[A-Z][a-z]+)*(?:\\s[rR]ainforests?)?\\b` is designed to capture phrases that typically represent location names. It starts by matching any word that begins with a capital letter, which is common for proper nouns such as place names. The pattern allows for additional capitalised words to form multi-word names. The optional part `(?:\\s[rR]ainforests?)?` is included to specifically capture terms like \"rainforest\" or \"rainforests\", which are relevant in the environmental context of our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filtering out false positives**: Chances are that the solution will include false positives like the standalone word \"Rainforest\". This would happen because the regex is general enough to capture any capitalised word, and \"Rainforest\" appeared in the text as part of a hashtag, which could lead to its unintended inclusion. To rectify this, we've added specific conditions in the filtering process:\n",
    "   * not `loc.endswith(':')` excludes matches that end with a colon, as these are more likely to be hashtags or other non-location elements.\n",
    "   * `'rainforest' in loc.lower()` ensures the phrase includes \"rainforest\" or \"Rainforest\", keeping the focus on relevant environmental terms.\n",
    "   * `loc != 'Rainforest'` explicitly excludes the standalone word \"Rainforest\" to avoid this specific false positive."

    "\n",
    "SQL queries might **take a long time to run** depending on the size of the database and the nature of the query. In addition, writing large SQL queries has the **potential to jam a server** (in a server-based configuration). For example, if a server spends too much time on a single query, other queries need to \"wait in line\" for the server to complete processing the one query. As a result, it is critical that we write more efficient queries, for example, queries that only read the data that is required."

This is because other factors outside of the database such as computer performance or network connection can impact the amount of time it takes to complete a query.\n",

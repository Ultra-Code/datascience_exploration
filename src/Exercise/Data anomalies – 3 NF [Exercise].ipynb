    "In this train, we will go through a practical example of normalising a database up to the **Third Normal Form**. We will look at some of the data anomalies that can occur in practice and, at the end of the train, reflect on how **3NF** attempts to mitigate them.  \n",

    "* Normalise a database up to the Third Normal Form.\n",
    "* Learn how to further decompose a 2NF database into more tables to help eliminate transitive dependencies.\n",

    "Data visualisation is the process of presenting data and information in graphical forms such as charts, maps, and diagrams. The goal of these graphics is to improve understanding of the underlying data by making patterns, trends, correlations, and outliers more visible than a simple study of the raw data.\n",

    "There may be numerous occasions when we will need to share our data-driven results and insights. Unfortunately, raw data are not appropriate for this purpose. This is where maximising the potential of data visualisation becomes critical. In this train, we will learn how to visualise data using Python's graphing library, Matplotlib, as well as how to identify the appropriate visualisation approaches to apply based on the data we are given.\n",

Initially, data may not be in a suitable format for direct plotting, necessitating tasks such as restructuring DataFrames and handling missing values. Additionally, data cleaning and quality assurance steps, including outlier removal and imputing missing values, ensure the accuracy of visualisations. Grouping, slicing, and aggregating the data play crucial roles in this process, allowing for the categorisation of data based on specific criteria, extraction of relevant subsets, and the creation of summarised perspectives through aggregation functions like sum, mean, or count. \n",

    "This chart holds so much information! Firstly, we see a general trend that as the group size increases, so does the bill total and the amount tipped. Interestingly, the scatter plot fans out in a cone shape, indicating that as the bill increases, there is also more variance in the tips produced. Lastly, it is also surprising to note that the highest tips produced come from mid-sized groups (three to four individuals). This may represent a dynamic where larger groups tend to both order and tip less, based on the fact that the bill is either being generously picked up by one group member or split by the group as a whole. It's important to note that this last point is an assumption, however, and cannot be supported by the chart alone – highlighting the need for further data-driven analysis which often accompanies the evaluation of a visualisation.
